Bytez analyzes binary files to determine their format, architecture, and programming language.

Currently Bytez only supports rust and C++ detection, for example if you try to run it on a c program it would detect the format and architecture fine but it won't be able to detect the language.

I plan to add C support later.

You can install bytez with cargo via ``cargo install bytez``
